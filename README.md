# Shape Calculator

This project is a shape calculator, which calculates the area and perimeter of a shape.
* This is done through having an interface class "Shapes", in which a specific shape must inherit and implement the following functions: 
  * calculateArea()
  * calculatePerimeter()
* There are only 4 shapes implemented, which are Sqaure, Rectangle, Triangle and Circle.
* However, more shapes can be included through inheriting and implementing the requried functions of the "Shapes" interface class.
